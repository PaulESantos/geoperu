The `geoperu` package provides a convenient interface to access official spatial datasets of Peru directly from R. These data are collected from the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics (INEI) of Peru.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `geoperu` as follows:

``` r
pak::pak("PaulESantos/geoperu")
```

To access spatial information of districts from any province in Peru, you can use the `get_geo_peru()` function.

```{r example}

library(geoperu)

cusco_sf <- geoperu::get_geo_peru("CUSCO", level = "dep", simplified = FALSE)
cusco_sf

prov_sf <- geoperu::get_geo_peru(c("ANTA", "Urubamba", "calca"),
                                 level = "prov", 
                                 simplified = TRUE)
prov_sf
```

To visualize the retrieved geospatial information with the `get_geo_peru()` function from the geoperu package, you can use various tools in R. A common option is to use the `ggplot2` library along with `sf` object visualization functionality.

Here's a basic example of how to visualize the data:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
prov_sf |> 
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf() +
  theme_bw()

```
You can customize the plot by adding additional layers, adjusting styles, and adding labels according to your specific needs.
